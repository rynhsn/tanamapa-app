# Sistem Penentu Lahan Perkebunan Tanaman Buah Menggunakan NodeMCU Berbasis IoT

## Description

This system is used to determine the suitable fruit plant types to be planted in a plantation area based on environmental parameters measurement such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall. The system uses NodeMCU, a microcontroller integrated with Wi-Fi module, to collect environmental data and send it to the server through an internet connection. The collected data is then processed using intelligent algorithms to determine the most suitable fruit plant types to be grown in the area, based on the measured plant growing preferences and environmental conditions.

## How It Works

The system works by collecting environmental data such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall using sensors installed in the area. The data is then sent to the NodeMCU microcontroller through the Wi-Fi module, where it is processed using algorithms to determine the most suitable fruit plant types to be grown in the area. The results of the processing are then sent to the server, which displays the information on a user-friendly interface.

## Installation

To install the system, you will need to set up the NodeMCU microcontroller and the sensors in the area. You will also need to install the software on the server, which includes the intelligent algorithms and the user interface. Detailed installation instructions can be found in the documentation provided with the software.

## Usage

To use the system, simply turn on the NodeMCU microcontroller and the sensors in the area. The system will automatically collect data and process it using the intelligent algorithms. You can access the results of the processing on the server through a web browser.
